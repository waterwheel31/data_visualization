# Build a Data Visualization Project 

This is the first exercise of Data Visualization Udacity Nanodegree. This uses Tableau to visualize data. 

This is a data of 'arrival of aircraft to Japan by Nationality' taking from Japanese Government Statistics. 

This shows that even in the global era, most of the aircrafts come form neibouring countries (except for the US)

Followings are done to make the chart
- Matching country code to country name using a code table 
- Aggregating to "Others" by using 'Set' function
